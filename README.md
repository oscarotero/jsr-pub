# jsr-pub

Utility to update the `deno.json` file with the fields required to publish to
[JSR](https://jsr.io/).

## Usage

Run this code changing the `PKG-NAME` with the name of the package you want to
publish:

```
deno run -A https://deno.land/x/jsrx@v0.1.0/mod.ts --name=PKG-NAME
```

It generates the fields `name`, `version` and `exports` in your `deno.json`
file.

- The `name` field is the same value passed as CLI argument.
- The `version` value is detected automatically from the most recent tag in the
  git repository
- The `exports` value is generated by scanning your code (more info below).

Then, you can run `deno publish --allow-dirty` to send the package to JSR.

## How `exports` are generated?

The `exports` field of JSR allows to change the real files of your modules. This
is used to provide extensionless specifiers. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "@my/package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "exports": {
    "./first-module": "./first_module.ts",
    "./second-module": "./second_module.ts"
  }
}
```

Now, you can import these modules with `@my/package/first-module` which returns
the file `./first_module.ts`.

### What's wrong with that?

This has several issues:

- The package is not longer compatible with the file system. For example, you
  cannot use a local version of this package for debuging purposes, because the
  paths of the modules are different.
- You don't know the format of the file you're really importing. This is
  specially critical for the
  [new import attributes](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes)
  standard that allows to import different types of modules like JSON, CSS etc.
- This is not compatible with web standards and makes more difficult to switch
  to HTTP imports in the future.
- It's an antipattern that even Node (which originally started this trend)
  [now recommends to avoid](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#extensions-in-subpaths):

  > With [import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) now providing a
  > standard for package resolution in browsers and other JavaScript runtimes,
  > using the extensionless style can result in bloated import map definitions.
  > Explicit file extensions can avoid this issue by enabling the import map to
  > utilize a
  > [packages folder mapping](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps#packages-via-trailing-slashes)
  > to map multiple subpaths where possible instead of a separate map entry per
  > package subpath export. This also mirrors the requirement of using the
  > [full specifier path](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#mandatory-file-extensions)
  > in relative and absolute import specifiers.
- It overlaps the import maps standard. For example, in Deno it's really painful
  [to combine JSR and import maps](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/23504#issuecomment-2073644331).

### How to fix this?

This script fixes this problem by generating exports compatible with regular
HTTP and file system imports:

- Scans your code searching for files with the extensions `.ts`, `.js`, `.tsx`,
  `.jsx` and `.mjs`.
- Files meeting any of the following conditions are ignored:
  - It's in the directory `/test/`, `/docs/`, `/deps/` or `/node_modules/`.
  - The name starts with `.` or `_` or is in a directory starting with `.` or
    `_`.
  - The name ends with `.test.*`, `_test.*`, `.bench.*`, `_bench.*`.
  - The name is `deps.*`.
- It generates the `exports` field keeping the filename intact, without removing
  the extension or changing the name.

For example, the following project:

```
├── docs/
|   ├── one.js
|   └── two.ts
├── src/
|   ├── one.js
|   ├── one.bench.js
|   ├── two.ts
|   └── two.bench.ts
├── test/
|   ├── one.js
|   └── two.ts
└── mod.ts
```

Generate the following exports:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": "./mod.ts",
    "./src/one.js": "./src/one.js",
    "./src/two.ts": "./src/two.ts"
  }
}
```

The `mod.*` file is automatically detected as the main module.

Now the specifiers in JSR are compatible with the filesystem, so it's possible
to switch to local imports or http imports easily at any time:

```
import one from "jsr:@my/package/src/one.js";
import one from "./vendor/my/package/src/one.js";
import one from "https://deno.land/x/my_package/src/one.js";
```
